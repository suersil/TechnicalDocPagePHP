                <p>WordPress (WP, WordPress.org) is a free and open-source content management system (CMS) written in
                    PHP[4] and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database.</p>
                <p>Features include a plugin architecture and a template system, referred to within WordPress as Themes.
                    WordPress was originally created as a blog-publishing system
                    but has evolved to support other web content types including more traditional mailing lists and
                    forums,
                    media galleries, membership sites, learning management systems (LMS) and online stores.</p>
                <p>To function, WordPress has to be installed on a web server, either part of an Internet hosting
                    service
                    like
                    WordPress.com or a computer running the software package WordPress.org in order to serve as a
                    network
                    host
                    in its own right.[10] A local computer may be used for single-user testing and learning purposes.
                </p>
                <p>"WordPress is a factory that makes webpages"[11] is a core analogy designed to clarify the functions
                    of
                    WordPress: it stores content and enables a user to create and publish webpages, requiring nothing
                    beyond
                    a
                    domain and a hosting service.</p>
                <p>WordPress has a web template system using a template processor. Its architecture is a front
                    controller,
                    routing all requests for non-static URIs to a single PHP file which parses the URI and identifies
                    the
                    target
                    page. This allows support for more human-readable permalinks.</p>

            <article>
                <p>WordPress users may install and switch among different themes. Themes allow users to change the look
                    and
                    functionality of a WordPress website without altering the core code or site content. Every WordPress
                    website requires at least one theme to be present. Themes may be directly installed using the
                    WordPress
                    "Appearance" administration tool in the dashboard, or theme folders may be copied directly into the
                    themes directory.[13] WordPress themes are generally classified into two categories: free and
                    premium.
                    Many free themes are listed in the WordPress theme directory (also known as the repository), and
                    premium
                    themes are available for purchase from marketplaces and individual WordPress developers. WordPress
                    users
                    may also create and develop their own custom themes.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Plugins">
            <header>Plugins</header>
            <article>
                <p>WordPress' plugin architecture allows users to extend the features and functionality of a website or
                    blog. As of December 2021, WordPress.org has 59,756 plugins available,[15] each of which offers
                    custom
                    functions and features enabling users to tailor their sites to their specific needs. However, this
                    does
                    not include the premium plugins that are available (approximately 1,500+), which may not be listed
                    in
                    the WordPress.org repository. These customisations range from search engine optimization (SEO), to
                    client portals used to display private information to logged-in users, to content management
                    systems, to
                    content displaying features, such as the addition of widgets and navigation bars. Not all available
                    plugins are always abreast with the upgrades, and as a result, they may not function properly or may
                    not
                    function at all. Most plugins are available through WordPress themselves, either via downloading
                    them
                    and installing the files manually via FTP or through the WordPress dashboard. However, many third
                    parties offer plugins through their own websites, many of which are paid packages.

                <p> Web developers who wish to develop plugins need to learn WordPress' hook system which consists of
                    over
                    2,000 hooks (as of Version 5.7 in 2021)[16] divided into two categories: action hooks and filter
                    hooks.
                </p>

                <p>Plugins also represent a development strategy that can transform WordPress into all sorts of software
                    systems and applications, limited only by the imagination and creativity of the programmers. These
                    are
                    implemented using custom plugins to create non-website systems, such as headless WordPress
                    applications
                    and Software as a Service (SaaS) products.</p>

                <p>Plugins also could be used by hackers targeting the site that use WordPress, as hackers could exploit
                    bugs on WordPress plugins themselves instead of exploiting the bugs on WordPress itself</p>

                    as

                    Accessibility
                    Coding Standards state that "All new or updated code released in WordPress must conform with the Web

                <div>Is WordPress no code?</div>
                <p>Building a WordPress site is mostly a code-free experience. We use the term mostly because using
                    one of the many thousands of templates does not require coding knowledge. However, if any
                    changes are made to the structure, styling, or even padding on a template, coding will be
                    required.</p>

                <div>Can I use WordPress for coding?</div>
                <p>Does WordPress require coding? Yes. Some knowledge of coding would be helpful to changes to your
                    website. Having a complete coding background while helpful is not required.</p>

                <div> How do I write code in WordPress?</div>
                <p> Simply edit the blog post or page where you want to display the code. On the post edit screen,
                    add a
                    new code block to your post. You can now enter the code <strong>"Snippet"</strong> in the text
                    area of the block. After
                    that, you can save your blog post and preview it to see the code block in action.</p>

                <title> Codes Snippets for WordPress</title>
                <div>Disable Admin Toolbar</div>
                <p>Some caching systems will require you not to have different code for logged in users vs public users
                    so disabling the WordPress admin toolbar can be useful for that case.

                    If you want to disable the WordPress admin toolbar on all pages for logged in users use the snippet
                    below in your themes functions.php. Example:</p>
                    <code>?php</code>
                <code>add_filter('show_admin_bar', '__return_false');</code>

                <div>Add an Admin User with PHP</div>
                <p>This code snippet is useful for adding a new admin to a site using the theme’s function.php.
                    This snippet will make a user with the username/password/email set in the variables. It’s important
                    to see that it will only try to make the user if it doesn’t exist based on the username/email so if
                    you have an account with your email address already you can fill in email with dummy data:
                </p>
              
                <code>function smartwp_create_admin_user(){
                    $username = 'yourusername';
                    $password = '2JyAEQJ9B9Jf5T8a';
                    $email = 'change@me.com';
                }</code>
                
                    <code>if ( !username_exists( $username ) && !email_exists( $email ) ) {
                        $userid = wp_create_user( $username, $password, $email );
                        $user = new WP_User( $userid );
                        $user->set_role( 'administrator' );
                      }</code>

                      <div>Disable XML-RPC in WordPress</div>
                      <p>Very rarely do you need XML-RPC enabled on your WordPress site but having it enabled can cause a slew of security issues.

                        If you use the WordPress app you may need to keep it enabled but I have rarely seen any case where XML-RPC enabled.
                        
                        This code snippet will disable XML-RPC to improve site security:</p>
                       
                        <code>add_filter('xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false');</code>
